# mapty
This is one of my udemy javascript course projects. In this project, you can keep track of your workouts on the map.
<br>
I have followed the course and built initial markup, workout adding and displaying functionality.
<br>
I have written independently the following functionality:
<ul>
  <li>Single workout deletion</li>
<!--   <li>Deletion of all workouts</li>
  <li>Zooming all workouts in one screen</li>
  <li>Hiding workout form when a user presses "escape" or with cursor somewhere else that is not map or form</li>
  <li>Displaying temporary marker when the user presses on the map and form appears</li>
  <li>Filtering workouts by type</li>
  <li>Sorting workouts by field values</li>
  <li>Editiong workouts</li>
  <li>Adding path on the map for the workout as additional feature in edit section</li> -->
</ul>
